SUBJECT :
 Subject: Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology Techniques.
 Subject code: SLE712
 Project type: Assignment 
 
INTRODUCTION :

This assignment consist of two-part. the first part is based on the logical and numerical solutions to the question.
Whereas, part B is working with a particular gene of the choice, finding a mutation , blasting the sequence and understanding
the effect of the proportion of blast on the various site of the gene.  

THE LIBRARIES USED IN THIS TASK :

Some general libraries involved to run this task are as follows:
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library("seqinr")
library("R.utils")
library("rBLAST")
library("ape")
library("Biostrings")
(*Note these libraries were necessary for us to run all the codes, 
it is possible that some of them would not be as necessary for others as it was for us.)
